# dsiaffiliates
Wiki-like repos for affiliates to share questions, information, projects, etc.

Use the Wiki for conversation and documentation.  Use the repository for code related to DSI projects and competitions.  Place code in folders devoted to your project, and put a documentation text file in the folder so everyone can see what it is.
